        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>make comments in Javascript by doing "/*" then "*/". Or if on a single line you can put "//" in front of it.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <li>Javascript is case sensitive when naming variables.</li>
          <li>To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in 'single' quote marks.</li>
          <li>Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li>Boolean is a True/False value.True and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.  it looks like this, "let myVariable = ['bob',10];", refer to each member as "myVariable[0]", then "myVariable[1]" etc.</li>
          <li>Everything in Javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          
          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <li>"+" adds two numbers together or combines two strings.</li>
          <li>"-,*,/" do what you would expect them to do in basic math.</li>
          <li>"=" assigns a value to a variable.</li>
          <li>"===" three equal signs makes a strict equality, this performs a test to see if two values are equal.  It returns a boolean or true/false result.</li>
          <li>"Not" is represented by "!" this returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes, for example, it turns true into false.</li>
          <li>"Does-not-equal" is represented by "!==" this test if things are not equal for example this code, "let myVariable = 3; myVariable !== 3;" returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3.</li>
        </ul>
