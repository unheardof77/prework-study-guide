# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
My motivation in building this website was to familiarize myself with the basics of HTML, CSS, Github, and Javascript.
I built this project to learn and explore different ways to code.
This solves my own needs of needing a document to take notes on, while allowing others to see my notes as well.
I learned many things including but not limited too; the basics of HTML, Javascript, and CSS.  As well as the Github flow.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

Starting from the top of the page, first you can click on the picture to change it to a different picture.  This is done by clicking on it with mb1.  Then it shows the notes I have taken so far on all the topics we have covered. If you open the console log it will randomly select a topic for you to study first so that way you don't have the stress of making that decision, it is decided for you.  It also logs all the topics covered.  Finally at the bottom, there is a button where you can put your name in for a custom greeting at 
the top of the webpage.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

One feature is a picture that changes when you click on it.  Another is a saveable name for a custom greeting.  This allows you to see who the last one to view your Prework Study Guide was.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

You can test the picture changing by clicking on the picture.  Another test you can run is hitting the change user button then refreshing the page.  You should see that your name will still be there.
